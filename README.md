# Professional-Portfolio
The nature of my work does not allow me to post many projects straight from work in this repository, but I will showcase various projects, tools, products related to coding, GIS, and my daily life. 

## About Me
Hello, my name is Wes Sholders. I am a geospatial proffessional working at the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
I studied Marine Biology and Marine Fisheries Management during my undergraduate program at Texas A&M University at Galveston. I then was blessed to be able to further pursue my
passion of GIS while studying for my Masters of Marine Resource Management, again at Texas A&M University at Galveston.

## What do I get to do at work?
Working at USACE has been great due to the wide range of work that falls under our scope. Any given day it could swing from developing web applications, data management/inventory, developing python scripts to automate processes, heading out into the field to collect photogrammetry data (we will have our own LiDAR drone soon!), or collecting bathymetry surveys of any of our 1,000 + miles of channel here on the Texas/Louisiana Coast.

## What do I like to do outside of work?
I am an avid outdoorsman who stays busy in the field all throughout the season. In the warmer months, you can usually find me fishing or crabbing, counting down the days until hunting season opens. Once Dove opener happens, I will be either dove or duck hunting somewhere in Texas. Duck hunting is my true passion and I have been able to use some of my GIS skills to better scout and find new hunting spots.

Besides hunting and fishing, you can find me playing disc golf or hiking.
