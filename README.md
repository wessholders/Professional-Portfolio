In this repository I will showcase various projects, tools, products related to coding, GIS, and my daily life.

## About Me
Hello, my name is Wes Sholders. I am a geospatial proffessional working at the United States Army Corps of Engineers.
I studied Marine Biology and Marine Fisheries Management during my undergraduate program at Texas A&M University at Galveston. I then was blessed to be able to further pursue my
passion of GIS while studying for my Masters of Marine Resource Management, again at Texas A&M University at Galveston.
