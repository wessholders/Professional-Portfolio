# MS of Marine Resource Management Professional Paper

For my end of degree Professional Paper, I was tasked with developing a research topic and paper. I decided to take a look at how Sea Level Rise (SLR) could impact the Houston Metroplex.

Due to it's low-lying topography, proximity to the Gulf, and history of sunsidence; the Houston area stands to be one of the most impacted areas in the United States of America when it comes to SLR.

Using tidally referenced DEMs created by NOAA, I plotted possible innundation surfaces for the Houston Metroplex under three different scenarios (low, medium, and high) brought forward by Lui et al. (2020) and NOAA (2022).

These innundation surfaces gave me insight to what areas, industries, cities, and infrastructure would be impacted most by SLR.
