# Flyway Weather Tracker
Those who know me, know that I am an avid outdoorsman, with waterfowl hunting being my drink of choice. Those that know me even better, know that I am a data nerd.
This of course leads to the conclusion that I _**need**_ to schedule a python script to help me track weather data for duck hunting.
