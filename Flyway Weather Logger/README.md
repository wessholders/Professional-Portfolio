# Flyway Weather Tracker
Those who know me, know that I am an avid outdoorsman, with waterfowl hunting being my drink of choice. Those that know me even better, know that I am a data nerd.

This of course leads to the conclusion that I _**need**_ to schedule a python script to help me track weather data for duck hunting.

### So what is the significance of weather data and duck hunting?
As most of us probably know, waterfowl are migratory birds. During the warmer months in North America, these waterfowl live in the far northern reaches of the United States, Canada, and even Russia; where they will raise their young. As the weather turns colder, these birds will prepare to migrate south to all areas of the United States, Mexico, and further south. There are several known and suspected triggers that tell waterfowl is time to migrate, many of those being related to the weather. These can be things such as temperature, wind direction, wind speed, barometric pressure, and even the moon phase.
