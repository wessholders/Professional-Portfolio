# Harvest Tracker
This is a harvest tracker I use to track the waterfowl harvest of my group every year. It has various columns for tracking hunters, species, sex ratio of harvest, and other meteorlogical variables. It has a second sheet that provides a roll-up of relevant metrics. The below link includes some dummy rows to demonstrate how it functions. Feel free to make a copy and track your own harvest stats.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Google sheets

This is a strightforward process that anyone could replicate with success, I just find it useful so I included it here. As I mentioned earlier, this will track species harvested, the sex of the harvest, who the hunter was, and several meteorological variables such as temperature, wind speed/direction, cloud cover, lunar cycle, etc. I also include coordinates for my hunts and later create a heat map so I can determine what areas produced the most productive hunts.

The roll-up in the other sheet will track metrics including total birds by hunter, total hunts by hunter, skunks, and some averages among other things. Personally, the average harvest per hunt is my favorite aspect about this tracker because it reminds me of doing fisheries statistics in college. We track a metric called Catch per Unit of Effort (CPUE) that gives a standardized way of tracking success of a trip. In this case our "Catch" is the number of birds harvested and our "Unit of Effort" is number of hunts. The effort could be many units such as hours spent hunting, miles walked, *mosquito bites recieved*... You get the idea. In my group the person who has the highest CPUE at the end of the season has ultimate bragging rights until the next season.



## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
